As an Biomedical Engineer I am,
currently working on devices such as EMGs, IMUs, Pressure- and Force Plates. 
Therefore my job as an intern is to create pipelines in Matlab, that are supposed to find errors within several filter options for those devices.
The Projects focus is on Signals from Markerless 2D Pose Estimation of Gait analysis. These come with different filter Options, which have to be compared to each other.

He/Him work as pronouns for me, though preferbly called by my name.

I always look forward to find new challenges, also outside of the biomechanical world.
Great interests in Energy Management, neural engineering or working on medical devices (Hardware/Software) in general.

Check out my LinkedIn to see, other stuff that I might achieve and follow me on my path, to great innovations. 
Open for projects!

These things might come in handy for your next project:

Java: Apps,DBs
C++: Embedded Systems with PlatformIO (very interested in more)
uC: Prototyping from scratch
C#: Unity3D, created VR Apps for Pico
Matlab: Signal Processing, Simulations, Managing big Datasets, Visualization, Analysis

Things I am going to learn: 

Python: might replace Matlab for me at somepoint, at least in industry I was told. 
Rust: for me as an addition to C/C++
C++: For Software development, and more embedded
