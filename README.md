As an Biomedical Engineer I am,
currently working with devices such as EMGs, IMUs, Pressure- and Force Plates. 
Therefore my job as an intern is to test Hardware and Software manually. Eventually check some data (mostly joint-angles from IMUs and Markerless Tracking (2D)) inside Matlab.

He/Him work as pronouns for me, though preferbly called by my name :).

I always look forward to find new challenges, also outside of the biomechanical world.
Great interests in Energy Management, neural engineering or working on medical devices (Hardware/Software) in general.

Some of my Skills might come in handy for your next project:

Java: Apps,DBs
C++: Embedded Systems with PlatformIO (very interested in more)
uC: Prototyping from scratch
C#: Unity3D, created VR Apps for Pico
Matlab: Signal Processing, Simulations, Managing Datasets, Visualization, Analysis

I want to grow as a character,
while I see myself as somebody with good communicational and teamplayer softskills, yet I must learn integrating those skills together with technologies like Github.
Also as a Software Engineer I strive to become experienced in architecture and writing good maintainable code.
